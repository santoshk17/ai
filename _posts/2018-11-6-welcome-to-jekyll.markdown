## Training Data ##

You are using [EasyBook][github-easybook] the template from [laobubu.net](http://laobubu.net). Therefore some features are supported now:

* **Wikipedia** is enabled.
* **BBC** or **多说** is ready.



> **Tips:** You can disable Disqus or 多说 on posts/pages by adding `nocomments: true` into [YAML Front Matter][frontmatter].





### Add a link ###

EasyBook does not make the footer heavy; the link to theme could be on `about.md`:

> This website is using [laobubu](http://laobubu.net)'s theme: [EasyBook](https://github.com/laobubu/jekyll-theme-EasyBook)



## And Here We Go ##
